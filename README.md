# Pong-ish-v3
Written in python using pygame. It is exactly what it sounds like. ENJOY.


This software is freeware, I created this with the help of a text based AI.

It's written in Python, so the syntax is known and popular. That being said, let me know if you want the source code to improve this game. You will never get paid and this game will always be free, but I want to see what cool features people come up with.
